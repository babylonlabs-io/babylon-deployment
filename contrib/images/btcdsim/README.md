# btcdsim

`btcdsim` is a Docker image we build to be able to run a single Bitcoin node in the local devnet that produces blocks at regular intervals without consuming CPU.

To achieve this we use [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd) in `--simnet` mode and make calls to the [generate](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/v0.23.1/rpcserver.go#L886) API endpoint.

The image also runs a [btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) process which can be used to make transfers. To talk to `btcd` programmatically we can use the [rpcclient](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/blob/v0.23.1/rpcclient/mining.go#L54-L62), and for the wallet the [chain](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/tree/master/chain) client.

## Build

You can build the image with the following command:

```bash
make btcdsim
```

## Test

One way to see if it works is to run the container interactively:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name btcdsim babylonlabs/btcdsim
```

The logs should show that a wallet is created with and mining is started:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm babylonlabs/btcdsim

IMPORTANT: Keep the seed in a safe place as you
will NOT be able to restore your wallet without it.
Please keep in mind that anyone who has access
to the seed can also restore your wallet thereby
giving them access to all your funds, so it is
imperative that you keep it in a secure location.

```

Then we can connect to this from another container to query the balance:

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
93e58681637d        babylonlabs/btcdsim   "/btcdsim/wrapper.sh"   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        18554-18556/tcp     btcdsim
$ docker exec -it btcdsim sh
/btcdsim # btcctl --simnet --wallet -u $RPCUSER -P $RPCPASS getbalance
600
/btcdsim #

```

The balance will go up as more blocks mature. The default coinbase maturity is 100 blocks.

## Use in docker-compose

The image has been added to the main `docker-compose.yml` file. It will build it if it's not built already and start running it as part of the local testnet. The other containers can use the default ports to connect to it, which are also exposed on the host.

It can be started on its own like so:

```bash
docker-compose up -d btcdsim
```

Currently the image doesn't support restarting, the container has to be completely removed and recreated if it's stopped. It can be removed with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop btcdsim
docker-compose rm btcdsim
```

The ports are mapped to the same default ports that `btcd` and `btcwallet` would use, so if the host already runs these services they might clash.
